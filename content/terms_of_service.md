## Terms of Service

This is a contract between you and Groundlist. By using our service you agree to these terms, and you consent to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy). 

"Our service" or "the service" means the Groundlist app and website and any plugins that we provide. "We" or "our" means the Groundlist organization. "You" means the person who signed up for the service and the organization you represent.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to provide high-quality software to advance the conservative cause. 

### Use

You agree to use this service solely for the purpose of helping a conservative or free-market-oriented cause. Conservative causes include Republican political campaigns, Republican party organizations, conservative or free-market-oriented advocacy or educational organizations, freedom-oriented public interest law firms, right-leaning social groups, certain ballot initiative groups, and similar organizations. To use this service for any other purpose you must get our explicit, official, written approval.

You agree to provide accurate, truthful, and non-misleading information about yourself on the registration screen. If you are affiliated with any Democratic, liberal, or left-leaning organization, you are expressly prohibited from using the service.

The service contains confidential and proprietary functionality, internals, data, know-how, and documentation. Keeping these things confidential is essential to our mission.  If you disclose any of our confidential information to any third party, especially those that do not support our mission, you will be held liable for damages. We may seek remedies for violation of this contract, and remedies under trade secret and copyright law. We may also refer you to law enforcement for criminal prosecution.

You agree not to send unsolicited communications through this service. You agree to comply with the CAN SPAM act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Do Not Call rules, and any related FCC regulations.

You agree not to reverse-engineer any part of this service, or attempt to probe or bypass any security measures.

You agree not to overload our servers through excessive or burdensome requests.

You agree not to use our service for any illegal purpose.

### Voter Files

We, or third parties, may make voter files available to you through this service. Voter files are subject to state law, and the law varies from state to state. You are responsible for knowing what you can and can't do under the law, and complying with it. For example, most states prohibit you from publishing the files or for using them for commercial purposes. The supplier of the file may have additional restrictions. You agree to follow the rules.

### Intellectual Property

You agree that we own all intellectual property in the service (except your data, per our Privacy Policy), including software design, graphic design, layout, data structures, documentation and functionality, and that we hold copyright, trade secret, and trademark rights in the service. You may not copy or duplicate any part of our service.

### Payment

While the base service is free, data and plugins offered by us or third parties may not be. You authorize us to charge your credit card for payment of any fees. When you purchase data or services from any third party through our service, we are merely a payment facilitator; your deal is with them. Refunds, if any, must come from them. We will facilitate the reversal of charges if the third-party vendor asks us to do so. We may terminate your account in the event of a dispute over payment.

### Taxes

Some jurisdictions require that we collect taxes on some payments made through this service. We try to avoid doing business in those jurisdictions. If we must collect taxes, the amounts will be over and above the price of the services or data you are purchasing. Sometimes a third party vendor will be the one responsible for collecting the taxes.

### Kids

You may not use this service if you are younger than 18. You may not not solicit or collect information from anyone under 18 in connection with this service. 

### Security

You agree not to share your password with anyone. Each person using the system must have their own login. You also agree not to share your API key(s) with anyone except to the extent necessary to actually use the API. We are not liable for any damages that ensue as a result of a leaked password or API key.

### Changes

There is a date at the top of the this document. If this document changes, the date will change also. That is how we will notify you of changes.

### Termination

You may only use our service in compliance with this agreement. You may terminate your use of this service at any time -- notify us and we will delete your account. You will still be bound to pay any outstanding balances and to comply with the surviving parts of this agreement, including the parts pertaining to intellectual property or dispute resolution. We may terminate your use of this service at any time for any reason.

### Disclaimer

We do not promise to provide any particular functionality or data. Our service may not meet your needs. Software and hardware errors occur and they may cause the system to go down, or to delete or corrupt data. We do not guarantee that this will not happen. We do not (currently) provide a service-level agreement.  We provide this service "as is".

### Limitation of Liability

WE PROVIDE NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.

OUR LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FEES YOU HAVE PAID US, EXCLUDING ANY FEES YOU HAVE PAID ANY THIRD PARTY THROUGH OUR SERVICE. WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES.

### Indemnification

If anyone sues us as a result of your use of our service, you agree to indemnify us.

### Venue

This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois. Any disputes under this contact shall be filed in a court of appropriate juridiction in Chicago, Illinois.
