## Why Groundlist?

Groundlist was designed by conservatives who were frustrated by the software available for managing political and advocacy campaigns.

A campaign needs software to do many things:

* Manage volunteers and donors
* Send mail
* Send email 
* Send texts
* Send social media messages
* Make phone calls
* Manage events
* Take donations
* Organize door-to-door work
* Manage a website
* Analyze voters
* See maps
* Deal with petitions
* (This list barely scratches the surface.)

Up to this point, you have had two choices:

1. Get a single campaign software solution that costs a lot and does everything poorly, or
2. Use different solutions for CRM, email, phone, donations and events and try to make them work together.

Anyone who has tried the second one knows how difficult and time-consuming it is.

### A completely different answer

The key thing to understand about campaign software is that everything involves operating on a list of people.
You gather contacts, analyze them, and communicate with them.

What if you could use many different applications, but have them operate on a common list of contacts? 
You could run a Facebook ad, take donations, and email the donors seamlessly. You'd have the best of all worlds.


Common contacts across applications
Shareable lists
Buy data
Plugins. Extend it yourself.



### It's free? Really?

Groundlist is free. The reason for this is twofold:

1. We're committed conservatives and we're tired of losing. Getting good quality software into the hands of conservative campaigns will help.
2. A vast amount of valuable data is lost at the end of every election cycle because people don't want to pay to keep it around.

Most campaigns pay for software, and then stop paying for it when the campaign is over. Their valuable lists disappear. No one is going to continue to pay a monthly fee for a campaign which is over.

But what if you could just leave your data somewhere between cycles and it didn't cost anything? What if, later, you could share that data with others who might like to use it? What if you could easily *sell* your data?

And even better, what if you could *buy* data from others when you really needed it? Like voter files, or models, or phone numbers, or gun owners, or political reporters? 

With Groundlist, you can buy data from whoever is selling. 

This is how Groundlist makes enough money to keep the lights on. If you choose to buy or sell data though our service, we take a small fee.

You can also buy services. If you want to use Mailchimp, for example, you'll have to pay their fees, or if you want to use a commercial
walk app, you'll have to make a deal with the vendor directly.

Eventually, we'll have some low-cost plugins built into Groundlist itself, with a pay-as-you-go pricing model. For example, $X to send Y emails.

But the core Groundlist service is, and will remain, free.


******************



 Be they volunteers, voters, the press, or some targetted subset of these lists


But here's the key thing: when you integrate solutionsall these different solutions really only need to share a list of people. Volunteers, 
donors, email list subscribers




The Groundlist premise is simple: conservative political campaigns will get better if there is a simple, free solution for managing lists of people and communicating with them efficiently.

Lists should be shareable. The owner of a list should be able to share it, selectively, with those he or she trusts.

At core, Groundlist is a political customer relationship management (CRM) system with an array of third-party plugins for a variety of campaign-related functions.

Groundlist is free. Third-parties can integrate with the system and can charge for their services. You, as the consumer, can use these premium services if you choose to, or not.






If you want to use many

Here's the key insight:

When you integrate apps, there
There's only a single point of integration
