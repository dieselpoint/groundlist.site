## Privacy Policy -- DRAFT

This document describes Groundlist's privacy policy.

### You own your contacts 

We won't disclose, rent or sell your lists. We understand that lists are the crown jewels of a campaign. They are yours.

You may elect to share your lists via our service, but that is under your control.

Understand that when you use a plugin, you may be sharing your list with the creator of that plugin. For example, a plugin vendor that cleans your lists may need to send your data back to their servers. Check the privacy policy for any plugin provider who isn't us.


### We own most everything else

We 



### We take security seriously

The security of your account, and your campaign data, is extremely important. We use data security best practices to keep everything safe. We use https, salt and hash passwords, use proper security groups at our cloud provider, and comb our code to ensure that only 
authorized access is granted.

That having been said, this isn't Fort Knox. Hackers can sometimes get past even best practices. We do not assume liability in the event of a data breach.

### We do not comply with the GDPR

This is an American company. If you want to use this service in the U.S. or in some other country that doesn't force you to put cookie consents on every website, go ahead. 

But if you live in a country that is under the control of effete Brussels euro-bureaucrats, forget it. We don't answer to them. They are not entitled to impose rules on an American company. And for that reason we don't do business in Europe.

We encourage you to move to better place, like Texas.

### We will disclose things if the lawyers make us

Our commitment to keeping your data private goes away in the face of a court order, but only to the extent that the order requires it. Our commitment to keeping your data private totally goes away if you sue us.
