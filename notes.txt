The Groundlist (marketing) website is done with Vuepress.

It should probably get redone with Nuxt static pages just to keep the cognitive overhead low.

The pages are markdown with formatting provided in the /theme

To build this thing from the beginning:

Start with a plain-vanilla Vuepress install.
The site goes in /docs, and vuepress stuff in docs/.vuepress

yarn docs:dev  // for dev
yarn docs:build  // puts static html in ../docs

You completely override the default theme by adding .vuepress/theme/Layout.vue.
That gives you a clean slate.

Add bootstrap with npm install bootstrap. That wipes out vuepress, for some unknown
reason. Reinstall with npm install -D vuepress.
Enable bootstrap like this: https://code.luasoftware.com/tutorials/vuepress/add-bootstrap-css-to-vuepress/

To enable scss processing, see https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/using-vue.html#using-components
yarn add -D sass-loader node-sass

Within the Layout.vue,
$site has site-wide info, including nav to other pages
$page has same info, but just for the current page.


TODO:

Import just the scss we need of bootstrap instead of all of it.
Import bootstrap js so the collapse menu works
If we do documentation, get a better local search, see mkdocs search

On safari, image and text don't line up properly. Google "safari bootstrap issues"
  The fix to add .row:before, .row:after { display: flex !important; } (or variations)
  does not work.
