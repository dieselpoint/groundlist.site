Pages are in /pages
  index and _slug
Layouts aren't used much. The error page is there.
/components has NavBar and Footer
/content has secondary pages, which get processed by the nuxt content module and served by _slug.vue

To test:
  yarn dev
To deploy:
  yarn generate

  git add -A
  git status // to see what's going on
  git commit -m "message here"
  git pull origin master  // in case there are changes there that aren't here. master->main for newer repos
  git push origin master


In May, 2023, I edited the generated site directly on github to remove links to app.groundlist.org.
The reason is that I wanted to shut the server down.
Properly recompiling the vue app wasn't an option because so many things were broken.
