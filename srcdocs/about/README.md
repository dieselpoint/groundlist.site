## About

Groundlist was designed by conservatives who were frustrated by the quality of software for managing political and advocacy campaigns.

The Groundlist premise is simple: conservative political campaigns will get better if there is a simple, free solution for managing lists of people and communicating with them efficiently.

Lists should be shareable. The owner of a list should be able to share it, selectively, with those he or she trusts.

At core, Groundlist is a political customer relationship management (CRM) system with an array of third-party plugins for a variety of campaign-related functions.

Groundlist is free. Third-parties can integrate with the system and can charge for their services. You, as the consumer, can use these premium services if you choose to, or not.

Groundlist is led by [Chris Cleveland](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clevelandchris/), who currently serves as chairman of the Chicago Republican Party.
