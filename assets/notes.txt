The right way to set up bootstrap:

Include bootstrap-vue.
https://bootstrap-vue.org/docs#nuxtjs-module

Include 
bootstrapVue: {
    bootstrapCSS: false, // Or `css: false`
    bootstrapVueCSS: false // Or `bvCSS: false`
  }

Create _variables.scss and a custom.scss. Variables import
@import "bootstrap/scss/functions";
@import "bootstrap/scss/variables";
@import "bootstrap/scss/mixins";
only. This is what you include when you need variables in a style section.
Consider using nuxt style-resources.

The custom.scss includes:
@import "_variables.scss";
@import "bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss";

This makes sure all styles are overridden.

In nuxt.config.js include
build: {
    extractCSS: true
}

This prevents the entirety of bootstrap being included in the header of every page.
Unfortunately, it extracts all css, even the page-specific stuff.
Consider using PurgeCSS to do css tree-shaking.
